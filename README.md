# MPC-for-gasexchange-in-gasoline-engine
A model predictive controller proposed method for gasoline engines in MATLAB/Simulink
This MPC was developed in MATLAB and Simulink for a master thesis at Linkoping University (ISY). 
The code for MPC functions are coded by Robin Holmbom, Phd Student at Linkoping University.
The structure is partially coded by George Jajji a M.Sc. student at Linkoping University and expanded upon for usage in the his Master Thesis.

The MPC is programmed with symbolic expression and is runned in Simulink. To be able to run the Simulink model you need to have qpOASES installed. qpOASES is an open-source QP-solver developed with MPC purposes in mind. It has a Simulink interface which is used in the thesis. qpOASES can be found at https://github.com/coin-or/qpOASES, with full manual and installation guides.
